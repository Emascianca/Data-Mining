Hello everyone! These are just a few of the many Notebooks I created together with two other colleagues to support a large and challenging university project. As you can see, the code is quite messy, but I wanted to share and showcase the process that led us to create a Neural Network and other algorithms, such as shapelet extraction from time series, gradient boosting, and time series clustering.
